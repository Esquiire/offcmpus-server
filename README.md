# Offcmpus Server

This repo makes up the core of our backend/server efforts for the Offcmpus platform, built with MongoDB, GraphQL, TypeScript + Node.ts/js.

To compile and build this code, you need:

- Our .ENV containing API and AUTH keys
- Node.js
- the required node packages (npm install)
- add whitelisted IPs on MongoDB
-  run `npm run dev-server`
